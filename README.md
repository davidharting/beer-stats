# Beer Stats

Just trying to explore the Pandas library. 

You can find the data I am using [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans/data) from Kaggle.

# Development

1. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage python versions
1. Add this snippet to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` to automatically switch to the correct ptyhon version.  
```bash  
eval "$(pyenv init -)"  
```
3. Create a virtual environment for this python project (from within this directory)
```bash
python -m venv ./
```
4. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source ./bin/activate
```
5. Install dependencies into the virtual environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
